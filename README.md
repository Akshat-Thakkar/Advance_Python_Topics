#Advance_Python_Topics

Key Advanced Python Topics to Cover
Recursive Functions
Understand how functions can call themselves to solve problems that can be broken down into smaller subproblems.

Iterators and Iterables
Learn the difference between iterables and iterators, and how to create and use them effectively.

Generators
Study generator functions and expressions to create iterators in a memory-efficient way.

Lambda Functions, filter, map, and reduce
Explore anonymous functions and functional programming tools for concise and expressive code.

Decorators
Learn how to modify or enhance functions and methods dynamically.

Memoization
Use decorators to optimize recursive functions by caching results.

List Comprehensions
Master this Pythonic way to create and manipulate lists efficiently.

Function Composition and Currying
Combine functions and work with higher-order functions for advanced functional programming.

Exception Handling
Deep dive into handling errors gracefully with try-except blocks, custom exceptions, and finally clauses.

File I/O
Learn to read from and write to files, including serialization and deserialization.

Multithreading and Synchronization
Understand concurrency, how to launch and manage threads, and synchronize access to shared resources.

Regular Expressions
Use regex for powerful pattern matching and text processing.

Testing
Introduction to writing tests using unittest, doctest, and pytest frameworks to ensure code reliability.
